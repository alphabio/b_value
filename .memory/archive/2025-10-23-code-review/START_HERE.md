# START HERE – Code Review 2025-10-23

This archive contains a fresh-eyes review and a short-term action plan.

Files:
- CODE_REVIEW.md – Full review with risks, strengths, and plan.
- MASTER_PLAN.md – Concrete tasks and owners checklist (proposed).

Immediate Next Steps (1-2 days):
1) Align README metrics with .memory/STATUS.md and the property counter script.
2) Add Biome override to disable noExplicitAny in tests to reduce lint noise.
3) Set realistic Vitest coverage thresholds, then ratchet up per wave.

Primary Goal (short-term): Reach 85-90% coverage with honest, failure-first tests and keep public docs accurate via automation.
