**Welcome!** This directory contains the handover from the test coverage session.

## 🎯 What Happened

We added comprehensive test coverage for 5 recently implemented typography properties:
- `letter-spacing`
- `text-transform`
- `vertical-align`
- `word-break`
- `overflow-wrap`

**Result**: 93 new tests, all passing ✅

---

## ✅ Verification Required

**Before you do ANYTHING else**, run the validation script:

```bash
.memory/archive/2025-10-22-test-coverage/VALIDATION.sh
```

**Expected Output**: "🎉 ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED"

If validation fails, **STOP** and investigate before proceeding.
