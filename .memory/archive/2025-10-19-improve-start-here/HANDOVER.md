# Session Handover: START_HERE.md Improvements

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Quality Gates**: ALL PASSING ✅
**Files Changed**: 2 (START_HERE.md, AGENTS.md)
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

---

## Summary

Improved START_HERE.md clarity, accuracy, and consistency based on comprehensive analysis of actual project structure and workflow patterns.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Session Workflow Order ✅

**Problem**: Circular dependency - archiving INDEX.md required knowing which session dir to archive to, but session dir was created in step 2.

**Solution**: Reversed order - create session directory FIRST, then archive INDEX.md to it.

**Before**:
```bash
# 1. Archive INDEX.md (ALWAYS FIRST)
cp .memory/archive/INDEX.md .memory/archive/$(ls -t .memory/archive/ | grep -E '^[0-9]' | head -1)/INDEX_ARCHIVED.md

# 2. Create your session archive
mkdir -p .memory/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[topic]/
```

**After**:
```bash
# 1. Create your session archive FIRST
mkdir -p .memory/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[topic]/

# 2. Archive INDEX.md to your new session directory
cp .memory/archive/INDEX.md .memory/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[topic]/INDEX_ARCHIVED.md
```

**Benefits**:
- No fragile `ls -t | grep` command
- Explicit target directory
- Clear sequence
- Cannot fail due to missing directories

---

### 2. Corrected Quality Gate Description ✅

**Problem**: `just check` description didn't match actual behavior.

**Actual justfile**:
```justfile
check: format fix typecheck
```

Where `fix` runs `biome check --write .` (auto-fix linting issues).

**Changed**: 
- From: `just check   # Format, typecheck, lint`
- To: `just check   # Format, auto-fix, typecheck`

---

### 3. Simplified DRY Check Instructions ✅

**Problem**: Specific grep command was provided but could match comments, strings, JSDoc.

**Changed**:
- From: `**Check**: grep -r "function functionName" src/. If count > 1, extract it.`
- To: `**Check**: Search for duplicate function implementations. If count > 1, extract it.`

**Rationale**: Gives principle without prescribing potentially fragile command.

---

### 4. Updated Navigation Section ✅

**Problem**: Hardcoded archive paths would become stale (referenced January dates, but actual archives are October).

**Changed**:
- Removed: Specific dated paths to ACTION_PLAN.md, FINAL_HANDOVER.md, CHECKPOINT_REVIEW.md
- Added: Generic pattern-based navigation with file types to search for

**Before**:
```markdown
**Roadmap**: `archive/2025-01-18-action-plan/ACTION_PLAN.md`
**Example refactor**: `archive/2025-01-18-checkpoint/FINAL_HANDOVER.md`
**Example DRY analysis**: `archive/2025-01-18-checkpoint/CHECKPOINT_REVIEW.md`
```

**After**:
```markdown
**Archives**: `.memory/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]/` - Find examples:
- HANDOVER.md files for session outcomes
- ACTION_PLAN.md files for roadmaps
- CHECKPOINT_REVIEW.md files for DRY analyses
```

**Benefits**:
- Won't become stale as new sessions are added
- Shows pattern for finding similar files
- Easier to understand structure

---

### 5. Clarified Round-Trip Testing ✅

**Changed "Add parser" pattern**:
- Added explicit expectation: "result equals input"
- Added step 5: "Add integration test in `test/integration/`"

**Added to Testing section**:
```markdown
Round-trip pattern: Parse → Generate → Parse, verify result equals input.
```

---

### 6. Improved Testing Documentation ✅

**Changed**:
- From: `pnpm test -- rgb       # Specific test`
- To: `pnpm test -- rgb       # Filter by pattern (matches file names and test descriptions)`

Explains what the pattern matches against.

---

### 7. Added Import Alias Source Reference ✅

**Changed**:
- From: `## Import Aliases` (section header only)
- To: `## Import Aliases\n\nDefined in \`tsconfig.json\`:`

Makes it clear where these are configured.

---

### 8. Fixed AGENTS.md Contradiction ✅

**Problem**: AGENTS.md said "Update START_HERE.md at session end with outcomes and next steps" but START_HERE.md explicitly prohibits status updates.

**Changed AGENTS.md**:
- From: `Update START_HERE.md at session end with outcomes and next steps`
- To: `Create HANDOVER.md at session end with outcomes`

**Rationale**: Maintains START_HERE.md as timeless instructions, puts session-specific content in HANDOVER.md files.

---

### 9. Minor Clarifications ✅

- Step 5: Added "at session end" to clarify timing
- Step 7: Changed "Commit" to "Final commit" to emphasize it's the last step

---

## Impact Assessment

**Improvements**:
1. ✅ Workflow now executable without errors
2. ✅ No more fragile shell commands
3. ✅ Documentation matches actual tooling
4. ✅ Archive references won't become stale
5. ✅ Consistency between AGENTS.md and START_HERE.md
6. ✅ Clearer testing and round-trip expectations

**No Breaking Changes**:
- All changes are clarifications and corrections
- No API changes
- No code changes
- No test changes

## Files Changed

### .memory/START_HERE.md
- Fixed session workflow order (lines 15-19)
- Corrected quality gate description (line 38)
- Simplified DRY check (line 50)
- Updated navigation section (lines 106-109)
- Clarified round-trip testing (lines 117-118)
- Improved testing documentation (line 164)
- Added import alias source (line 154)
- Minor clarifications (lines 26, 30)

### AGENTS.md
- Fixed contradictory instruction (line 26)
- Now consistent with START_HERE.md's "no status updates" rule

---

## Verification

```bash
just check  # ✅ PASS - Format, auto-fix, typecheck all pass
just test   # ✅ Not run (no code changes, only documentation)
```

---

## Recommendations

1. **For next session**: Use the improved workflow - it's simpler and more robust
2. **Archive maintenance**: Consider periodic cleanup of very old archives
3. **Future improvements**: Could add a script to automate session setup (step 1-2)
