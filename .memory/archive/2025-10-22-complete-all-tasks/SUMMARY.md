**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Duration**: ~10 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Clean baseline restored

---

## What Happened

User requested to get "back on track" with a "clean/efficient API". Previous session had done exploratory research on Universal API redesign which left the codebase in a partially-modified state.

## Actions Taken

1. **Reverted uncommitted changes** - Restored all deleted files:
   - `src/universal.ts`
   - `src/universal.test.ts`  
   - `src/universal-batch.test.ts`
   - Integration tests for pointer-events and user-select

2. **Verified baseline** - Ran full test suite:
   - ✅ 3032/3032 tests passing (100%)
   - ✅ Lint/typecheck clean
   - ✅ Property count: 109 properties

3. **Cleaned up artifacts**:
   - Removed disabled test files
   - Archived research documents to this directory
   - Updated STATUS.md with current state

4. **Committed clean state** - One clean commit documenting the restoration

## Current State

**✅ CLEAN BASELINE - Ready for Work**

- Tests: 3032/3032 passing (100%)
- Lint: Clean
- TypeCheck: Clean  
- Git: Clean working tree
- Universal API: Working and stable
- Property Count: 109 CSS properties

## What Was Archived

This directory contains research from exploratory sessions that were done but not implemented:

1. **result-migration-nuclear/** - Plan for nuclear Result<T> migration (not needed)
2. **result-type-evaluation/** - Analysis of Result type patterns (informational)
3. **universal-api-research/** - Universal API redesign research (already working fine)

These documents are archived for reference but do NOT need to be implemented. The current API is clean, efficient, and working perfectly.

---

## What's Next

**Focus**: Complete Phase 1 (1 property remaining)
- Implement `content` property for pseudo-elements
- Reach 110 properties = Phase 1 complete
- Then proceed to Phase 2 (Tier 2 properties)

**No cleanup needed. No refactoring needed. Just feature work.**

---

## Key Takeaway

The API was already clean and efficient. The exploratory research confirmed this. We're back on track with a solid baseline, ready to continue implementing properties according to ROADMAP.md.
