# Architectural Decisions Record (ADR)

**DATE**: 2025-10-19
**STATUS**: Active
**VERSION**: 1.1.0

---

## Purpose

This document records all major architectural decisions made for b_value to ensure consistency and provide context for future development.

---

## Executive Summary

b_value is a CSS value parser/generator library extracted from b_gee. These ADRs document key design decisions as we build a standalone, reusable foundation that will eventually replace b_gee's internal parsing logic.

### Key Decisions

1. **Progressive Disclosure API** - Provide both simple auto-detecting functions and expert-level granular control

## Quick Reference

| ADR | Title | Status | Category | Priority | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|----------|----------|------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-convenience-api.md) | Convenience API Layer | ‚úÖ Approved | API Design | High | 2025-10-19 |

## Status Legend

- ‚úÖ **Approved** - Active decision, implemented or ready to implement
- üìã **Proposed** - Under review, ready for implementation approval
- üîÆ **Deferred** - Acknowledged but not currently needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer decision

## Context: b_value Extraction Journey

### The Origin Story

b_value was **extracted FROM b_gee**, not the other way around:

```
1. ‚úÖ b_gee built FIRST (production, 1585 tests)
2. üîÑ b_value being EXTRACTED (in progress)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è b_gee will be GUTTED to use b_value (future)
```

### The Ecosystem

```
b_short (shorthand expansion)
    ‚Üì
b_value (value parsing) ‚Üê WE ARE HERE
    ‚Üì
b_gee (stylesheet IR)
    ‚Üì
Studio (visual editor)
```

This context is crucial for understanding why certain decisions are made. b_value must be:
- **Feature complete** - Match everything b_gee needs
- **Migration friendly** - Make b_gee's transition smooth
- **Production ready** - Same quality standards as b_gee
- **Standalone useful** - Support independent users too

## Contributing

When adding a new ADR:

1. Create a new file: `ADR-{next-number}.md`
2. Follow the existing template structure
3. Update this README with a new entry in Quick Reference table
4. Link from relevant documentation
5. Consider the b_gee migration impact
