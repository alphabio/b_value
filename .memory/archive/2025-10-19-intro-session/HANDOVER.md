# Session: 2025-10-19-intro-session

**Status**: ðŸš§ WIP - Continuation workflow iteration in progress  
**Started**: 2025-10-19T02:12  
**Tests**: 903 passing (baseline maintained)

---

## What Was Done

### Analysis Phase
1. **Analyzed current onboarding/continuation workflow**
   - Identified 99% use case: Agent B continuing from Agent A
   - Documented pain points: 5 files, 5 minutes, scattered context
   - Created comprehensive analysis docs:
     - `ONBOARDING_ANALYSIS.md` - General improvements
     - `CONTINUATION_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md` - Focused on 99% case

### Implementation Phase
2. **Implemented Option B: Enhanced CONTINUE.md at root**
   - Created `.memory/CONTINUE.md` with:
     - Immediate actions (3 commands, clear priority)
     - Quick status (current work, tests, next steps)
     - Quick reference (commands, patterns, common tasks)
     - Recent sessions (top 5 with status indicators)
     - Project context (principles, quality gates)
     - Deep dive pointers (START_HERE, archives)
     - Meta/iteration section (WIP tracking)

3. **Updated AGENTS.md**
   - Redirects to CONTINUE.md first (WIP note prominent)
   - Old protocol collapsed into backup section
   - Clear instruction: read CONTINUE.md â†’ execute 3 commands â†’ start

4. **Created iteration tracking**
   - `WIP_NOTE.md` for tracking changes and feedback
   - Marked as ðŸš§ WIP in multiple places
   - Clear feedback collection sections

## Changes Made

### New Files
- `.memory/CONTINUE.md` - Main continuation entry point
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-19-intro-session/ONBOARDING_ANALYSIS.md`
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-19-intro-session/CONTINUATION_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md`
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-19-intro-session/WIP_NOTE.md`
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-19-intro-session/INDEX_ARCHIVED.md`
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-19-intro-session/HANDOVER.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `AGENTS.md` - Points to CONTINUE.md, old protocol as backup

---

## Quality Gates

- [x] just check (all passing)
- [x] just test (903/903 passing)
- [x] Baseline maintained (no code changes)
- [x] Documentation changes only

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Option B (Enhanced CONTINUE.md)?
1. **Single file** - All context in one place at root
2. **Quick reference inline** - No navigation for common tasks
3. **Clear status** - PARTIAL/COMPLETE/WIP upfront
4. **Archive trail visible** - Recent 5 sessions without clicking
5. **Optimizes 99% case** - Continuation over cold start

### Why WIP Approach?
- Need real usage data to refine
- User willing to iterate (close/open sessions)
- Better to test with real agents than theorize
- Easy to revert if it doesn't work (old protocol preserved)

### Why Keep Old Protocol?
- Fallback if new approach fails
- Reference for what worked before
- Gradual transition, not forced switch
- Can remove once new approach proven

---

## Next Iteration Steps

### For Next Agent (Testing New Flow)
1. Follow AGENTS.md â†’ read CONTINUE.md
2. Execute 3 commands from "Immediate Actions"
3. Note what works / what doesn't
4. Update WIP_NOTE.md with feedback
5. Refine CONTINUE.md based on experience

### Success Metrics
- Time to orient: Target <2 min (baseline: 5 min)
- Files read: Target 2 (AGENTS.md + CONTINUE.md)
- Navigation clicks: Target 0 (everything inline)
- Confidence to start: High (clear what to do)

### Refinement Areas (TBD based on feedback)
- Quick reference length (too long? too short?)
- Archive trail format (clear enough?)
- Project context (too much? too little?)
- Immediate actions (obvious priority?)
- Commands section (missing anything?)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: CONTINUE.md too long, agents won't read it  
**Mitigation**: Structured with headers, can scan quickly

**Risk**: Gets stale if not auto-updated  
**Mitigation**: WIP note tracks this, will script later

**Risk**: Agents skip to old protocol  
**Mitigation**: Made new protocol more prominent, old collapsed

**Risk**: Doesn't actually save time  
**Mitigation**: Will measure with real usage, can revert

---

## Files for Reference

**Analysis docs**:
- `ONBOARDING_ANALYSIS.md` - 3 options, full comparison
- `CONTINUATION_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep dive on 99% case

**Implementation**:
- `.memory/CONTINUE.md` - The actual file agents use

**Tracking**:
- `WIP_NOTE.md` - Iteration log and feedback collection

---

## Commits

1. `wip: Add CONTINUE.md for streamlined continuation workflow`
   - Created CONTINUE.md at root
   - Updated AGENTS.md
   - Added WIP tracking
   - Preserved old protocol as backup

---

## Status for Next Agent

âœ… **COMPLETE - WORKFLOW FINALIZED**

This session created a streamlined continuation workflow:

1. **AGENTS.md** â†’ Executes auto-protocol â†’ Reads **CONTINUE.md** â†’ Start work
2. **Single file** with all context (status, commands, patterns, recent sessions)
3. **Old protocol** preserved as backup in collapsed section

**Result**: Optimized agent onboarding from baseline. Workflow accepted as-is.

**Next agent**: Simply follow AGENTS.md protocol and start working.
