# WIP: Continuation Workflow Iteration

**Status**: ðŸš§ Actively iterating  
**Started**: 2025-10-19T02:12  
**Approach**: Create CONTINUE.md, test with real sessions, refine

---

## What We're Testing

**Created**: `.memory/CONTINUE.md` at root (Option B from analysis)

**Hypothesis**: Single file at root with inline quick reference will reduce continuation time from 5 min â†’ 2 min.

**Changes made**:
1. Created `.memory/CONTINUE.md` with:
   - Immediate actions (3 commands)
   - Quick status (what's happening now)
   - Quick reference (commands, patterns, tasks)
   - Recent sessions (archive trail, top 5)
   - Project context (principles, gates)
   - Deep dive pointers (START_HERE, archives)
   - Meta section (WIP notes, iteration log)

2. Updated `AGENTS.md`:
   - Top section now points to CONTINUE.md
   - Old protocol collapsed into `<details>` as backup
   - Added WIP note

3. Created this WIP_NOTE.md to track iteration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Agent B can get oriented in 2 minutes (vs current 5)
- [ ] Agent B doesn't need to navigate to multiple files
- [ ] Quick reference has all essential commands
- [ ] Status is immediately clear (PARTIAL vs COMPLETE)
- [ ] Archive trail gives enough context without clicking

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 (2025-10-19T02:12)
**Created**: Initial CONTINUE.md
**Next**: Close/open session, see what works/breaks
**Questions**:
- Is quick reference section too long?
- Is archive trail format clear?
- Are immediate actions obvious enough?
- Do we need more/less project context?

## Next Steps

After this iteration:
1. [ ] User closes session
2. [ ] User opens new session (fresh agent)
3. [ ] Fresh agent follows AGENTS.md â†’ CONTINUE.md
4. [ ] Fresh agent reports experience
5. [ ] Refine CONTINUE.md based on feedback
6. [ ] Repeat until optimal

Once stable:
7. [ ] Script the auto-generation (`just offboard`)
8. [ ] Remove old PROTOCOL_FIRST flow
9. [ ] Update START_HERE to reference CONTINUE
10. [ ] Document final workflow
