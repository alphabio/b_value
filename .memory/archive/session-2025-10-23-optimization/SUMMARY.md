# Session Summary: Optimization & Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Session handover optimization + test coverage

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. Test Coverage Work
- ✅ Added 4 test files for text-decoration generators
- ✅ Added 27 new tests (2122 → 2149)
- ✅ Coverage: 69.22% → 69.78% (+0.56%)
- ✅ All tests passing

**Files Created**:
```
src/generate/text/line.test.ts (7 tests)
src/generate/text/style.test.ts (8 tests)
src/generate/text/color.test.ts (6 tests)
src/generate/text/thickness.test.ts (6 tests)
```

### 2. Session Handover Optimization ⭐
Created 3 new documents to solve the "slow start" problem:

**`.memory/SESSION_START.md`**
- Reduced startup from 3+ minutes → 30 seconds
- Single command for context + baseline
- Clear workflow: start → work → end

**`.memory/SESSION_NEXT.md`**
- Single source of truth for "what's next"
- No more reading long STATUS files
- Updated after each session

**`.memory/TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md`**
- Documents `as any` pattern for error testing
- Explains why `biome-ignore` is OK in tests

**Updated `AGENTS.md`**
- Optimized auto-execute protocol
- Remove wasteful steps (git log, archives, etc.)
- Focus on: tests passing? coverage? next task?

## 📊 Coverage Progress

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Tests | 2122 | 2149 | +27 |
| Coverage | 69.22% | 69.78% | +0.56% |
| Test Files | 208 | 212 | +4 |

**Phase 1 Progress**: 3/5 batches complete
- Need +5.22% more to hit 75% target

---

## 🔑 Key Insights

### Problem Identified
We were spending **3-5 minutes at session start**:
- Reading long documents (STATUS.md)
- Running redundant checks (git log, coverage)
- Searching for context
- Re-verifying baseline

**This is unsustainable for a multi-session effort.**

### Solution Implemented
**Measure once, cut many times**:
1. ONE command at start (30 sec)
2. Read ONE file (SESSION_NEXT.md)
3. Start working immediately
4. Update ONE file at end

## 🎯 Next Session

**Read**: `.memory/SESSION_NEXT.md` (literally the only file needed)

**Task**: Phase 1 Batch 4 - Background parsers (5 files, 20 min)

**Command to start**:
```bash
cd /Users/alphab/Dev/LLM/DEV/b_value && \
just test 2>&1 | tail -3 && \
echo "📊 Coverage:" && \
pnpm test:coverage 2>&1 | grep "Coverage for" && \
echo "🎯 Next:" && cat .memory/SESSION_NEXT.md | head -10
```
