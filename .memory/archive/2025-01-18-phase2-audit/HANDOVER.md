## What Next Agent Should Know

### 1. Everything is Working ‚úÖ
All quality gates pass. Code is production-ready.

### 2. Coverage is Honest
89% line coverage is excellent for parsers with defensive error paths. The uncovered lines are:
- Defensive "should never happen" checks
- Error paths for malformed CSS (rare)
- Exhaustive type checks

### 3. Transform Parser is Complex
The transform parser handles 20+ function types with complex branching. 71% branch coverage is good given the complexity.

### 4. Documentation is Comprehensive
All decisions, fixes, and rationale are documented in `.memory/archive/2025-01-18-phase2-audit/`.

### 5. Ready for Phase 4
Next phase should focus on:
- Color value parsing (rgb, hsl, hex, named colors)
- Background properties
- Multiple backgrounds
- Color manipulation utilities

## Commands for Next Agent

### Verify State
```bash
just check      # Verify format, lint, typecheck
just test       # Verify all tests pass
just coverage   # Verify coverage passes
git status      # Verify clean working tree
```

### Start Phase 4
```bash
mkdir -p .memory/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-phase4-colors/
# Begin work...
```

### Review Documentation
```bash
cat .memory/START_HERE.md
ls .memory/archive/2025-01-18-phase2-audit/
```

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

### None Blocking
All known issues were resolved. Minor tech debt documented:

1. **Duplicated helper functions** - parseLength, parseAngle, etc. across parsers
2. **No shared css-tree utilities** - Each parser reimplements AST walking
3. **Position type complexity** - 2D/3D/List split may be over-engineered

These can be addressed in a future refactoring pass.
