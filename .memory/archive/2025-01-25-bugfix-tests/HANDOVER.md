# Session Summary: Test Fixes & Typography Coverage Boost

**Date**: 2025-01-25
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

## 📊 Metrics
- **Coverage**: 89.01% → 89.13% (+0.12%)
- **Tests**: 3,480 → 3,488 (+8 tests)
- **Commits**: 1 commit (test fixes + typography improvements)
- **Test Suites**: 347/347 passing
- **All Checks**: ✅ Passing

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. **Test Fixes** (10 files, resolved all build/lint errors)
   
   **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Tests were using incorrect `kind` fields on primitive types (angle, length)
   - Schemas (`angleSchema`, `lengthSchema`) **never** had `kind` fields
   - Tests incorrectly added them: `{ kind: "angle", value: 45, unit: "deg" }`
   - Correct format: `{ value: 45, unit: "deg" }`

   **Files Fixed**:
   - `src/generate/gradient/conic.test.ts` - Removed `kind` from angles/positions (5 locations)
   - `src/generate/gradient/radial.test.ts` - Removed `kind` from lengths (2 locations)
   - `src/generate/transition/transition.test.ts` - Changed `type: "custom"` to `type: "identifier"`
   - `src/generate/shadow/box-shadow.test.ts` - Added biome-ignore for intentional `as any`
   - `src/generate/shadow/shadow.test.ts` - Added biome-ignore for intentional `as any`
   - `src/generate/shadow/text-shadow.test.ts` - Added biome-ignore for intentional `as any`

### 2. **Typography Coverage Boost** (+4 files, +8 tests)

   **Module Coverage Improvement**: 83.01% → 86.36% (+3.35%)

   **Files Enhanced**:
   - `font-family.test.ts`: 87.5% → 92.5% (+2 tests)
     - Added: parse exception test, invalid value type test
   
   - `font-weight.test.ts`: 80.95% → 90.47% (+2 tests)
     - Added: invalid value type test, parse exception test
   
   - `letter-spacing.test.ts`: 79.48% → 89.74% (+2 tests)
     - Added: invalid value type test, parse exception test
   
   - `line-height.test.ts`: 82.6% → 91.3% (+2 tests)
     - Added: invalid value type test, parse exception test

## 🎯 Session Goals Achievement

✅ **Primary Goal**: Resolve all `just check` and `just test` errors
✅ **Secondary Goal**: Boost coverage toward 90%
⚠️ **90% Target**: Not reached (89.13% vs 90%) - need +0.87% more

## 🔧 Key Learnings

1. **Schema Design Philosophy**: Primitive types (angle, length, percentage) don't need `kind` fields because TypeScript's structural typing already distinguishes them by their properties.

2. **Type Safety**: The tests exposed that we had incorrect type data from the beginning - the schemas never matched what tests were using.

3. **Coverage Strategy**: Focusing on error paths (catch blocks, invalid inputs, edge cases) is effective for pushing coverage higher.

## 📈 Coverage Analysis

**Current State**:
- Overall: 89.13%
- Typography module: 86.36%
- Almost all individual files at 100%
- Remaining gaps are mostly error paths

**Path to 90%**:
- Need: +0.87% coverage
- Best targets: More error path testing in modules with consistent patterns
- Alternative: Test generation dispatch functions (clip-path, transform origin)

## 🎯 Next Session Recommendations

**To reach 90%**, choose one approach:

### Option A: Quick Win - Generate Dispatchers (~0.5% impact)
```bash
# Test these dispatcher files at 27-28% coverage:
src/generate/clip-path/clip-path.ts     # 27.27%
src/generate/clip-path/inset.ts         # 8.57%
src/generate/transform/origin.ts        # 28.57%
```

### Option B: Systematic - Parse Error Paths (~0.4% impact each)
```bash
# Add error tests to parse modules at 80-90%:
parse/color/* (lab, lch, oklab, oklch, hsl, hwb, rgb)
parse/filter/* (brightness, contrast, grayscale, etc.)
parse/animation/* (direction, fill-mode, play-state, name)
```

### Option C: Documentation - if 90% not critical
Focus on API documentation, examples, and integration guides.

## 📝 Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Start fresh
cd /Users/alphab/Dev/LLM/DEV/b_value
just test && just check

# Check specific low-coverage file
cat src/generate/clip-path/clip-path.ts
cat src/generate/clip-path/clip-path.test.ts

# Coverage for specific module
pnpm test:coverage 2>&1 | grep "generate/clip-path"

# Find all files under 90%
pnpm test:coverage 2>&1 | grep -v "100\s*|" | grep "\.ts"
```
