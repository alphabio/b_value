## ðŸŽ¯ Why These Were Archived

These documents served their purpose in planning the coverage push but became obsolete because:

1. **Progress exceeded plans** - 82.58% coverage vs 74% target in old plans
2. **Strategy changed** - Shifted from big plans to incremental testing
3. **Current state documented** - All info now in STATUS.md and SESSION_NEXT.md
4. **Execution complete** - Plans executed, patterns documented
5. **Keeping .memory/ lean** - Only 6 essential docs remain
