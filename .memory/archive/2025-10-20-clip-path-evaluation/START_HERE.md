# 🚀 START HERE - Clip-Path Gold Standard Refactoring

**New agent?** This is your entry point!

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify baseline (MUST PASS)
just check && just test
# ✅ Should see: 2318 tests passing

# 2. Read the plan (5 min)
cat .memory/archive/2025-10-20-clip-path-evaluation/MASTER_PLAN.md

# 3. Check what's done
cat .memory/archive/2025-10-20-clip-path-evaluation/PROGRESS.md

# 4. Read your session
cat .memory/archive/2025-10-20-clip-path-evaluation/SESSION_1.md

# 5. Create your directory
mkdir -p .memory/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-clip-path-dry-session-1/

# 6. Start coding!
```

## 📚 Documents Guide

**Start with these (in order)**:

1. **START_HERE.md** ← You are here
2. **MASTER_PLAN.md** - Big picture (15 min read)
3. **PROGRESS.md** - Status tracker (2 min check)
4. **SESSION_N.md** - Your session guide (detailed)

**Reference as needed**:
- **SUMMARY.md** - Quick overview
- **EVALUATION.md** - Technical deep dive
- **REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md** - Code examples

## 🎯 What You're Building

**Goal**: Transform clip-path parsers from 33% duplication → 8% (Gold Standard)

**How**: 3 focused sessions
- Session 1: Create parse wrappers (~75 min)
- Session 2: Add helper utilities (~55 min)
- Session 3: Final polish + docs (~50 min)

**Result**: Beautiful, maintainable, educational code ✨

## 📊 The Journey

```
Before:                       After:
965 lines                     775 lines (-20%)
33% duplication              8% duplication (-75%)
Good code                    Gold Standard code ✨
3 basic helpers              8 elegant utilities
```

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
- [ ] `just check` passes
- [ ] `just test` shows 2318 passing
- [ ] You've read MASTER_PLAN.md
- [ ] You understand the 3-session structure
- [ ] You're excited to ship Gold Standard! 🎉

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

- ✅ How to eliminate code duplication
- ✅ How to design reusable abstractions
- ✅ How to refactor without breaking tests
- ✅ How to achieve engineering excellence

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Test After Every Change** - Catch issues early
2. **One File at a Time** - Incremental progress
3. **Preserve Behavior** - No logic changes
4. **Document Decisions** - Clear commit messages
5. **Celebrate Wins** - Recognize achievements

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Test Coverage is Sacred
- All 307 clip-path tests MUST pass
- No test modifications allowed
- Tests validate correctness

### Error Messages Matter
- Preserve exact error text
- Tests depend on specific messages
- Don't "improve" during refactoring

### DRY vs Readability
- Extract patterns used 3+ times
- Keep helpers simple and focused
- Code should read like prose

## 📞 Need Help?

**Lost in the plan?**
→ Read MASTER_PLAN.md section "North Star"

**Don't understand the duplication?**
→ Read EVALUATION.md section "DRY Analysis"

**Need code examples?**
→ Read REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md sections

**Stuck on implementation?**
→ Read SESSION_N.md "Common Issues" section

**Previous session unclear?**
→ Read `[session-dir]/HANDOVER.md`

## 🎯 Success Looks Like

After Session 1:
```typescript
// BEFORE (35 lines of boilerplate)
export function parse(css: string) {
  try {
    const astResult = AstUtils.parseCssString(css);
    if (!astResult.ok) return err(astResult.error);
    
    const fnResult = AstUtils.findFunctionNode(astResult.value, "rect");
    if (!fnResult.ok) return err(fnResult.error);
    
    const args = AstUtils.parseFunctionArguments(fnResult.value);
    // ... 100+ lines of rect logic ...
  } catch (e) {
    return err(`Failed to parse rect(): ${e.message}`);
  }
}

// AFTER (3 lines!)
export function parse(css: string) {
  return parseShapeFunction(css, "rect", parseRectArgs);
}
```

**That's the power of DRY!** ✨

## 🏆 Why This Matters

This isn't just refactoring - it's:
- 📚 **Educational**: Learn industry best practices
- 🔧 **Practical**: Make code maintainable
- 🚀 **Valuable**: Portfolio-quality work
- ✨ **Satisfying**: Watch tests stay green!

---

## ⏱️ Time Budget

- **Planning**: ✅ Done (2 hours)
- **Session 1**: 60-90 min
- **Session 2**: 45-60 min
- **Session 3**: 45-60 min
- **Total**: ~3-4 hours execution

**ROI**: Infinite! This code will be used for years.
