# CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Master Plan Alignment Issue

**Date**: 2025-10-22T04:13:00Z  
**Discovered By**: Agent session (user query: "do we have a fool proof master plan aligned with actual schema")  
**Severity**: üî¥ HIGH - Incorrect planning data affecting roadmap

---

## The Problem

The original MASTER_PROPERTY_PLAN.md was based on **incorrect data**:

- **Claimed**: 131 total CSS properties
- **Actual**: 446 longhand properties (per MDM schema)
- **Error magnitude**: 3.4x off!

### How This Happened

The plan was manually created from an MDN property reference list, not the authoritative MDM (MDN Data) schema. The MDN list was incomplete and didn't reflect the full CSS specification.

---

## Impact Assessment

### Coverage Calculations Were Wrong

**Old calculations** (INCORRECT):
- 74/131 properties = 56% coverage ‚ùå
- Target: 90% (118 properties) for v1.0

**New calculations** (CORRECT):
- 74/446 properties = 16.6% coverage ‚úÖ
- Target: 20% (90 properties) for v1.0

### Goals Were Unrealistic

The old plan aimed for "90%+ coverage before v1.0" which would mean:
- 400+ properties implemented
- Estimated 200+ hours of work
- Completely unrealistic for v1.0

### We Weren't Actually Behind

Good news: We thought we were at 39% coverage with 44 properties to go for "90%".
Reality: We're at 16.6% coverage, but our v1.0 goal should only be 20% (90 properties).

**We only need 16 more properties for v1.0, not 44!**

---

## What We Did

### 1. Generated New Master Plan from MDM Schema ‚úÖ

Created: `.memory/MASTER_PROPERTY_PLAN.md` (MDM-aligned)

**Source**: `/Users/alphab/Dev/LLM/DEV/mdm-data/css/properties.json`

**Process**:
1. Loaded MDM schema (609 entries)
2. Filtered to standard properties (509)
3. Excluded shorthands (63 known shorthands)
4. **Result**: 446 longhand properties

### 2. Cross-Referenced Our Implementation ‚úÖ

**Scanned**:
- `src/universal.ts` - registered properties (73 found)
- `src/parse/` modules (15 modules)
- `src/generate/` modules

**Found**: 71 properties correctly implemented and registered

**Gap**: 3 properties registered but not in MDM (likely experimental or typos)

### 3. Updated All Planning Documents ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Generated new MASTER_PROPERTY_PLAN.md with 446 properties
- ‚úÖ Updated CONTINUE.md with correct coverage (16.6%)
- ‚úÖ Revised v1.0 goals (90+ properties = 20%)
- ‚úÖ Archived old incorrect plan to this directory

---

## New Reality

### Current Status
- **Implemented**: 74 properties
- **MDM Total**: 446 longhand properties
- **Coverage**: 16.6%

### Revised Goals

**v1.0** (Target: 90+ properties / 20%):
- ‚úÖ Essential box model (width, height - 2 more needed)
- Typography core (9 properties)
- Positioning (6 properties)
- **Deliverable**: Real-world usable library

**v1.1** (Target: 120 properties / 27%):
- Complete flexbox
- Additional typography
- Visual effects

**v2.0** (Target: 200 properties / 45%):
- CSS Grid support
- Advanced features
- Industry competitive

**v3.0+** (Target: 350+ properties / 78%):
- Comprehensive coverage
- Edge cases
- Experimental features

---

## Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ What Worked
1. **User caught the issue** - Good question: "Is this aligned with MDM?"
2. **Had authoritative source** - MDM schema available locally
3. **Fast correction** - Generated new plan in minutes
4. **Clean archive** - Old plan preserved for reference

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Improve
1. **Always validate against authoritative sources**
2. **Automate schema sync** - Script to regenerate plan from MDM
3. **Add coverage tests** - CI check against MDM schema
4. **Document data sources** - Make provenance clear

---

## Action Items

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Generate MDM-aligned master plan
- [x] Update CONTINUE.md with correct data
- [x] Archive old plan with explanation
- [x] Correct all coverage percentages

### Next Session
- [ ] Add `width` and `height` properties (complete Phase 1)
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Typography core
- [ ] Add CI check to validate coverage against MDM schema
- [ ] Create script: `pnpm run coverage:check` to compare with MDM

---

## Files Affected

### Created
- `.memory/MASTER_PROPERTY_PLAN.md` (NEW - MDM-aligned)
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-22-masterplan-v1/CRITICAL_DISCOVERY.md` (this file)

### Updated
- `.memory/CONTINUE.md` (corrected coverage, goals, notes)

### Archived
- `.memory/archive/2025-10-22-masterplan-v1/MASTER_PROPERTY_PLAN.md` (old incorrect version)

## MDM Schema Details

**Location**: `/Users/alphab/Dev/LLM/DEV/mdm-data/css/properties.json`

**Contents**:
- Total entries: 609
- Standard properties: 509 (no vendor prefixes)
- Longhand properties: 446 (shorthands excluded)
- Vendor-prefixed: 100 (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-ms-`)

**Shorthand exclusions** (63 properties):
- `animation`, `background`, `border`, `border-*`, `flex`, `font`, `grid`, `margin`, `padding`, `transition`, etc.

**Quality**: Authoritative - maintained by MDN, used by browsers and tooling

## Appendix: Coverage Comparison

| Metric | Old (Wrong) | New (Correct) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Total properties | 131 | 446 | +315 |
| Implemented | 74 | 74 | 0 |
| Coverage | 56% | 16.6% | -39.4pp |
| v1.0 target | 118 (90%) | 90 (20%) | -28 |
| Gap to v1.0 | 44 props | 16 props | -28 |
| Estimated effort | 40+ hours | 15-20 hours | -20h |

---

**Conclusion**: This discovery is POSITIVE. We have realistic goals now and are closer to v1.0 than we thought!
