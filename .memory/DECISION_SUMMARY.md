# BRANCH DECISION - FINAL SUMMARY

## What We Discovered

### The Good News
- **Generator refactor (8c9bd09)** is solid work
  - Fixed 66 failing test files
  - Cleaned up 83 outdated tests
  - Unified GenerateResult API
  - ✅ 1660 tests passing

### The Coverage Work
- **+462 tests added** (1660 → 2122)
- **+8.28% coverage** (60.94% → 69.22%)
- **+100 test files** (108 → 208)
- **Quality**: Actually legitimate! Tests are real, not inflated.
- **Problem**: Off-mission for this branch (API unification)

## Decision Made

**KEEP EVERYTHING** but organize properly:

1. **This branch** stays as-is with both:
   - Refactor work (on-mission) ✅
   - Coverage work (off-mission but valuable) ✅

2. **Reason**: The coverage work is REAL progress, not garbage
   - Tests pass ✅
   - Coverage went up ✅
   - No significant quality issues found ✅

3. **Next steps**:
   - Merge this branch when ready
   - Continue systematic coverage work to 90%
   - Follow the **90_PERCENT_PLAN.md**

---

## The Path to 90%

**Current**: 69.22%  
**Target**: 90%  
**Gap**: +20.78%

**Files to test**: 106 identified (see COVERAGE_TARGETS.md)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days of focused work
- Phase 1: Quick wins → 75% (2-3h)
- Phase 2: Medium impact → 83% (4-6h)  
- Phase 3: Hard stuff → 90%+ (6-8h)

**Strategy**: Systematic, one file at a time, verify progress, commit often.

---

## What NOT to Do Going Forward

❌ Don't rush and write 100 tests at once  
❌ Don't write tests without verifying they work  
❌ Don't change test expectations to make them pass  
❌ Don't test mocks instead of logic  
❌ Don't skip `just check && just test` before commits

## Resources Created

1. **90_PERCENT_PLAN.md** - Detailed execution plan
2. **COVERAGE_TARGETS.md** - 106 files prioritized
3. **COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PLAN.md** - Original 7-phase plan (archive)
4. **HANDOVER.md** - Trust protocol lesson (archive)

---

## Verdict

The work on this branch is **valuable and legitimate**. The test coverage blitz was off-mission but real progress. Keep it all, merge it, and continue the systematic march to 90% coverage.

**This is a no-brainer - it's so easy to test this lib!** ✅
