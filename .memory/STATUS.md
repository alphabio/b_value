### Priority 2: Phase 2 Properties (Tier 2 - Common)
- Focus on high-usage, medium-complexity properties
- See ROADMAP.md for full list
- Target: 150+ properties this month

### Short-term Goal: v1.0.0
- Complete Phase 1: Tier 1 CRITICAL (16 properties)
- Reach 110 properties (25% coverage)
- CHANGELOG, version bump, npm publish

### Long-term (This Month)
- Grid layout support (40% usage, high complexity)
- 150+ properties (common module coverage)
