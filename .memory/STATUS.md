## What's Next

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Create accurate ROADMAP.md** - Module-based view of 94 properties + 352 remaining
2. **Update AGENTS.md** - Reference STATUS.md and count script
3. **Verify next property priorities** - Check usage data for highest-impact additions

### Near-term (This Week)
1. **Complete remaining Tier 1 CRITICAL** - Font styling, text decoration, overflow
2. **Reach 100+ properties** - Target high-usage properties
3. **Prepare v1.0 release** - CHANGELOG, version bump, npm publish

### Long-term (This Month)
1. **Grid layout support** - 40% usage, high complexity
2. **150+ properties** - Common module coverage
3. **Documentation website** - TypeDoc or Docusaurus
