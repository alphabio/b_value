# Session Handover: Test Coverage Experiment Abandoned

**Date**: 2025-10-22T19:20:00Z  
**Agent**: Claude  
**Duration**: ~1 hour

---

## What Happened

Attempted to increase test coverage from 60.94% → 90% by creating generator tests. **This was misguided**.

### Why It Failed

1. **Wrong API Pattern**: Created tests for `generate()` function, but `.generate.ts` files use **named exports** like `generateBackgroundBlendMode()`
2. **Auto-Generated Code**: The `.generate.ts` files appear to be auto-generated by tooling (see `scripts/create-template.ts`)
3. **Not the Priority**: Per project goals, implementing properties is the focus, not test coverage

### What Was Created (Then Deleted)

- 68 test files following wrong pattern
- All `.generate.test.ts` files deleted
- Clean baseline restored: 1692/1692 tests passing, 60.58% coverage

---

## Current Status

✅ **Clean baseline**  
- 1692 tests passing (100%)
- 60.58% coverage
- No lint/type errors
- Ready to resume property implementation

---

## For Next Agent

**DO NOT** attempt to increase test coverage by creating generator tests. The `.generate.ts` files:
- Use named exports (e.g., `generateBackgroundBlendMode`)
- Are likely auto-generated
- Don't follow the standard `generate()` pattern

**DO** focus on:
- Implementing remaining properties per `ROADMAP.md`
- Following existing patterns in `src/generate/` and `src/parse/`
- Letting coverage improve naturally as properties are added

---

## Key Files

- **Status**: `.memory/STATUS.md` (updated)
- **Roadmap**: `.memory/ROADMAP.md` (unchanged)
- **Baseline**: 1692 tests, 60.58% coverage
