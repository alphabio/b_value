# Next Session: Final Push to 89%

**Current Coverage**: 86.33% (honest measurement)
**Target**: 89% (+2.67%)
**Status**: ✅ 3305 tests passing, all checks passing

## 🎉 Session 5 Achievements

1. **Fixed TypeScript errors** in parser tests (csstree.Number → NumberNode)
2. **Added shadow & transition tests** (+45 tests, +0.65% coverage)
3. **Added keyword validator tests** (+53 tests for documentation)
4. **Refined coverage config** (+1.07% by excluding barrel exports)
5. **Created ADR** for system-colors deprecated vs supported

**Total Progress**: 84.61% → 86.33% (+1.72%)

## 🎯 What to Test Next (2.67% needed)

Use the HTML coverage report to find actual gaps:
```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

Look for files with <90% coverage, prioritize:
- Generators with complex logic
- Parsers with edge cases
- Utilities with low coverage

**Skip**:
- Index files (barrel exports - already excluded)
- Files already at 100%
- Examples directory

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. ✅ **Check HTML coverage report first** - don't guess
2. ✅ **Exclude barrel exports** - they're just re-exports
3. ✅ **ADRs for spec issues** - document don't fix during coverage push
4. ✅ **Verify coverage gains are real** - check if files have logic to test
