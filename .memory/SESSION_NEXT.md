# Session 6: Progress to 89%

**Current Coverage**: 86.74% (was 86.33%)
**Target**: 89% (+2.26% remaining)
**Status**: âœ… 3320 tests passing, all checks passing

## âœ… Session 6 Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Critical Bugs in Gradient Generators (+0.41% coverage)
- **Bug**: `positionToCss()` returned `GenerateResult` instead of `string`
- **Impact**: Generated CSS had `[object Object]` instead of position values
- **Fixed**: radial.ts and conic.ts now return string correctly
- **Tests Added**:
  - radial.test.ts: 7 tests (position, colorSpace, size, shape combinations)
  - conic.test.ts: 8 tests (from angle, position, colorSpace combinations)
- **Coverage**: generate/gradient 63.58% â†’ 94.44% âœ“

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Test Next (2.26% needed)

Based on coverage report analysis, focus on:

### High-Value Targets (Real Coverage Gaps)

1. **Position/Transform Utils** (~0.7% impact)
   - `generate/position/utils.ts` - 48% coverage
   - `generate/transform/utils.ts` - 56.47% coverage

2. **Parse Utilities** (~0.5% impact)
   - `utils/ast/functions.ts` - 66.66% coverage
   - `utils/parse/color-components.ts` - 80.9% coverage

3. **Linear Gradient** (~0.3% impact)
   - `generate/gradient/linear.ts` - 78.78% coverage
   - Lines 126, 151, 159-160 uncovered

4. **Parse Layout** (~0.4% impact)
   - Various layout parsers at 60-85% coverage
   - Focus on error path coverage

### Commands

```bash
# Check specific file coverage
pnpm test:coverage 2>&1 | grep "generate/position"
pnpm test:coverage 2>&1 | grep "utils/ast"

# View uncovered lines
cat src/generate/position/utils.ts | sed -n '72,98p'
cat src/utils/ast/functions.ts | sed -n '79,143p'
```
